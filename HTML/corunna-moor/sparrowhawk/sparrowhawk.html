In the spring and summer of 2024, a pair of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_sparrowhawk">
Eurasian Sparrowhawks</a>
nested and successfully raised two chicks in the woodland of
the 
<a href="../index.html">
Corunna Moor.
</a>
This is their story and a record of the observations
I made during that period. Neither the pictures nor
the clips are of professional quality.

<b> Short description.</b>
An Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter Nissus) is a small bird of prey.
A female has brown barred underparts and dark brown or grey-brown upperparts
and is 35-40 cm tall with wingspan 67-80 cm. 
A male, much smaller than a female, is 30-34 cm tall with wingspan 60-64 cm. 
It has slate-grey upperparts and finely red-barred
underparts. A male sparrowhawk hunts mostly small birds while
a female can hunt a bird as large as a wood pigeon.

The Corunna sparrowhawks.

I would occasionally see both a female and a male on the moor
and in the nearby trees.
The next two pictures are from the fall and winter of 2023.
On the first one the female is resting after chasing a flock of waxwings. 
She often stands on one leg.

The male is much more elusive and I managed to take only
a few pictures of him. On this photo he landed on a tree
after flying  just above my head.
Both hawks have a few  white feathers on
their upperparts.

After weeks of searching I finally locate the nest.  It is in 2/3 of the height
of the highest spruce adjacent to the trunk. Such location is very common for
sparrowhawks.

After a successful hunt, the male arrives with a prey, gives a brief call
after which the female leaves the nest, picks up the food from the male
and eats. The pick up is often a mid-air claw-to-claw. This footage shows
the female eating a bird she just got from the male. The fact that she
is eating outside the nest suggests that the chicks haven't hatched yet.

After I return, I am anxious to know whether the young birds
survived. On the first day I can see just one at a time.
Young sparrowhawks make a lot of noise and it is very quickly
clear to me that both of them have survived. This is in fact the easiest
way to see a sparrowhawk: to follow the calls of the young ones.

The young are still being fed by the parents. Both parents constantly hunt to
feed the young and themselves. Their main hunting area is somewhere out of the
moor. After killing a bird they bring it and pass it to a young. First come,
first served. The adult does not even need to call, the young immediately know
a parent is coming and they quickly approach them to snatch the food. This happens
so quickly that it is nearly impossible to photograph.
On this clip one of the young is eating. Notice her long legs when she takes
off after dinner.

A family of magpies and carrion crows live in the woodland. While the crows
hardly bother the sparrowhawks, the magpies bully the young quite often
(usually in the morning). A group of magpies surrounds a hawk and one of
them attacks from behind. The hawk then picks one of the magpies and chases
it sometimes nearly killing it. After several days of such brawls it is clear
that the magpies stand no chance.

A danger for young sparrowhawk is posed by larger birds of prey such as
goshawk, owl or eagle as well as a pine marten. In the afternoon, a common
buzzard visits the woodland.  The mother hawk appears out of nowhere and
starts harassing the buzzard. The crows and magpies see it and join in and
the buzzard flies away with no harm to the young sparrowhawks. I haven't managed
to take a reasonable picture.

Alpha is exploring bigger and bigger area surrounding the Corunna Moor.
In this clips she is on the grass of the golf course. The first footage
shows her being harassed by a barn swallow (a family of them lives in the
club building). In the second one she seems to clean her bottom.

I see Alpha's first successful kill. She sits on a spruce on the
border with whitebeams at the height slightly above the whitebeams. Beta
makes noise and flies away and sit higher on a spruce. Alpha remains at her
place and after a minute later jumps down into the whitebeam and reappears a
fraction of a second later with a bird in her claws. Quickly flies away north
along the line of whitebeams making an adult call.
