Blackbird
</a>
</b>
<br>
Ubiquitous on the moor and in the area. Their singing is distinctive 
in the spring and summer. They become almost quiet in the autumn and winter,
when they only produce a slightly chirping sounds. The picture below
shows a young one. The second picture shows a

Common chaffinch

The easiest place to see a chaffinch is the woodland between the moor
and the golf course. Either high on the spruces or on the bordering
whitebeams. Also, like most of the birds on the moor it can be seen
on the cotoneaster.

To the best of my knowledge, a couple of stonechats were only visiting for a day
in October. The pictures below were taken on October 18, 2022 and this is the only
day I saw these beautiful birds. They were as easy to photograph as robins, showing
almost no fear even when I approached them very closely.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose">
Geese
</a>
</b>
<br>
Not resident of the moor but can be spotted migrating. What always confused me in the autumn
was that many flocks of geese were heading North rather than South. One of the reasons is that
there may be geese coming here for winter from Norway. However, it is probably more complicated.
After a bit of investigating
I learned that before the actual migration the geese explore different feeding grounds and
that is why they are seen to fly in the "wrong" direction.

Goldcrest
</a>
</b>
<br>
What is the evolutionary benefit of having such a grumpy face? A goldcrest is restless small bird, the
size of a blue tit. It took me about twenty minutes to make just a few acceptable shots. It was not
bothered much by my presence, just jumping from one branch of gorse to another every second.

One of the most beautiful birds on the moor. The easiest place to spot them are the
tops of spruces in the end of summer. Flocks of goldfinches feed on ripe cones (see

I am not sure kestrels nest on the moor, however, they hunt there
from time to time. Often being chased away by magpies or crows.

Mistle thrush
</a>
</b>
<br>
Actually, I am not sure whether this is a mistle thrush, not a song thrush. They are very hard
to tell apart (even the 
<a href="https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/u23/downloads/pdfs/thrushes_01_2012_low_res.pdf">
instruction</a> of the British Trust of Ornithology did not help me). 
The one on the picture was less timid than usually song thrushes are and that is
why I suspect it may be a mistle.

There are a few kinds of pigeons on the moor. The one on the picture below
is a wood pigeon and they nest high on the spruces. Earlier they attempted
to nest on the trees in the gardens adjacent to the moor but the presence
of cats chased them away to the woodland.

Redwing (near threatened)

<br>
A small bird of "near threatened" conservation status. Visits us mostly in winter, probably
from Norway.  This year (2022) a large flock (see the third picture) arrived in
December and most of it stayed for three weeks. On arrival they were seen on
the moor and the trees on Corunna Road, while later mostly in the woodland
between the moor and the golf course.

Robin

<br>
A very common and iconic bird. They can be seen and heard everywhere on the moor. Quite
friendly to people, often come very close. On the other hand, aggressive towards other
small birds. They produce many different sounds, the most distinctive being something
between clicking or smacking. When you stand near the gorse you can hear it from many places
as robins call each other.

The bird on the picture is a house sparrow. I suspect that there may also be tree sparrows on the moor,
but I haven't yet verify it. I only recently learned about the latter species and it is interesting
to know whether they live on the moor.

Treecreeper

As the name suggest this small bird creeps up the trees. In search of food under the folds
of the bark it climb up a tree, then flies down and repeats the climbing. Not shy at all
it is a pleasure to watch from a relatively close distance.

Water rail
</a>
</b>
<br>
Quite rare in this part of Scotland. A few birds (I saw three) visited the moor in November and
stayed for a few days. As the name suggests its natural habitats are banks of rivers and lakes,
that makes it an uncommon visitor. Walks in search for food and when scared runs with the head
down. That is why initially I thought it was a wounded song thrush.
