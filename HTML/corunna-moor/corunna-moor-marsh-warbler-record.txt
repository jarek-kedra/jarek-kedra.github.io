July 19 (evening).
I come back from Europe after 4 week travel. I go the moor and notice a strange bird call.

July 20.
Same bird call. I notice a warbler and try to take a picture.

July 21-26.
I take more pictures and I try to identify the bird. All books I have, google and youtube provide confusing answers.

July 27.
I write to Ian Broadbent, the bird recorder for North-East Scotland, and ask for help. I send a picture and a description of the call. He suggests a Sedge Warbler or a Willow Warbler, although my description of the call does not fit the picture for neither of them.

July 28.
I manage to take better pictures and send them to Ian together with a record of the call. He thinks it may be a Reed or a Marsh Warbler. 

July 29.
Ian and his dad come to see the birds and they identify them as breeding Marsh Warblers. They inform local birders Ian and Roddy. Roddy visits in the afternoon.

Ian contacts Ian Francis from the Rare Breeding Birds Panel and they think it is 6th or 7th record in Scotland. 

I visit the birds in the evening, around 19:00. My presence does not bother them much. They don't produce the usual distressed call, Just the sharp 'tzak'. I see them on a few short occasions. No chance to take a picture, though.

July 30.

Morning: the birds active in the buddleia and alders. I saw two of them at the same time on one buddleia. They are exploring further afield: the whitebeams along the street, thistle next to my garden. I can even hear one just now from my kitchen.

I took some pictures of the birds on a buddleia. I seems that there were more than two at the same time but I can't be sure. Some of them look smaller and more scruffy (the picture when the bird raises its head).

Correction by Ian B.: The smaller fellow is a willow warbler. I removed the pictures.

Evening: I meet Ian. Birds not as noisy as on previous evenings. They fly between the gorse and buddleia. We see them form time to time, but there are no chances for a decent picture.
