July 19 (evening).
I come back from Europe after 4 week travel. I go the moor and notice a strange bird call.

July 20.
Same bird call. I notice a warbler and try to take a picture.

July 21-26.
I take more pictures and I try to identify the bird. All books I have, google and youtube provide confusing answers.

July 27.
I write to Ian Broadbent, the bird recorder for North-East Scotland, and ask for help. I send a picture and a description of the call. He suggests a Sedge Warbler or a Willow Warbler, although my description of the call does not fit the picture for neither of them.

July 28.
I manage to take better pictures and send them to Ian together with a record of the call. He thinks it may be a Reed or a Marsh Warbler. 

July 29.
Ian and his dad come to see the birds and they identify them as breeding Marsh Warblers. They inform local birders Ian and Roddy. Roddy visits in the afternoon.

Ian contacts Ian Francis from the Rare Breeding Birds Panel and they think it is 6th or 7th record in Scotland. 

I visit the birds in the evening, around 19:00. My presence does not bother them much. They don't produce the usual distressed call, Just the sharp 'tzak'. I see them on a few short occasions. No chance to take a picture, though.
